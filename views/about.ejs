            of any sort that have to deal with multi-location inventory. 
            We work closely with our users to ensure a smooth and easy 
            experience so that our services make their days easier, rather than 
            convolute and complicate their systems with multiple processes. 
            Distro is an evolving system, and additions are being made regularly 
            to help improve the user experience, and make running a business 
            that much easier. Try Distro today!"
